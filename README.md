1. for solution to problem 1 in this assignment we have created a simple dictionary that gives marks corresponding to each member. Then we ask the user to input the student's name then we check if the student is present in dictionary and if student is present then we look for marks and if student is not in the dictionary then we print the massage "student not found".
2. for the solution to problem 2 we have created the list that was asked in the question and then sliced it for obtaining the first 5 elements and created a new string of these elements then reversed this and printed these lists.
